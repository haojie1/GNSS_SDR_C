# GNSS_SDR_C
This is a software GNSS receiver in C based on the receiver in "A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver: A Single-Frequency Approach"
## Get start
run "make" command

## System requirements
gsl libirary is need

## Test Environment
code has just tested in ubuntu 20.04.1

## Running the GNSS SDR software
1. step into this folder
2. config this software receiver to suit your signal file
   all configuration can be done in only one file named initSetting.c
   these are variables you may need to modify
   - fileName( the name of your signal file )
   - msToProcess( total processed time )
   - intermediatFreq( intermediate frequency )
   - samplingFreq( sampling frequency )
3. run ./GNSS_Receiver

## Results description
- L1Ant1.dat is a signal file generated by a simulator(NOT I/Q FILE). it's intermediate frequency is 1.42MHz, and sampling frequency is 10MHz. Data type is int8.
- IE.dat, IP.dat and IL.dat are I path results of ealy code path, prompt code path and late code path respectively. QE.dat, QP.dat and QL.dat have the similar meaning.
- pos.dat is the output of postion, once one millisecond.

## Resources
Notes: this code most is ported from the software receiver in "A Software-Defined GPS and Galileo Receiver: A Single-Frequency Approach". So if you want to know more details, you can read this book or send email to me.
